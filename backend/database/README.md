# Database Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the database structure and its purpose within the application. The database is designed to support the functionality of the backend, ensuring that data is stored efficiently and securely.

## Purpose

The database serves several key functions:
- **Data Storage**: It stores all application-related data, including user profiles, application settings, and other relevant information.
- **Data Retrieval**: It allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data to support application features.
- **Data Integrity**: It enforces data integrity and relationships between different data entities.

## Database Technology

The database is implemented using sqlite, which provides robust features for performance, scalability, and reliability.

## Backup and Maintenance

Regular backups should be performed to prevent data loss. Ensure that maintenance tasks are scheduled to optimize database performance.
